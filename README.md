# CSS-Selector-Cheatsheet
A cheatsheet for CSS Selectors

Unless differently specified, classes, ids and elements are interchangeable.
*element* = selects a DOM *element* called ‘element’
__#id__ = selects an __id__ called ‘id’
*__.class__* = selects a *__class__* called ‘class’

## The basics
*element*, *__.class__* = selects an *element* called ‘element’ and a *__class__* called ‘class’
*parent child*  = selects an *element* called ‘child’ inside an *element* called ‘parent’
*parent__.child__* = selects a *__class__* called ‘child’ inside an *element* called ‘parent’
